            <h3>Episode IV</h3>
            <h1>A new hope</h1>
            <p>
                It is a period of civil wars in the galaxy. A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has challenged the tyranny and
                oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE.
            </p>
            <p>
                Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, rebel spaceships have won their first victory in a
                battle with the powerful Imperial Starfleet. The EMPIRE fears that another defeat could bring a thousand more solar systems
                into the rebellion, and Imperial control over the galaxy would be lost forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new battle station. Powerful enough to
                destroy an entire planet, its completion spells certain doom for the champions of freedom.
